# Creating agendas

In this section we will cover why you might want to use an agenda, how to structure the beinging, middle, and end of an agenda, as well as how you might choose to build off of that agenda for the next meeting.
Meetings can provide the center of a community connection through shared work and networking.
When you design an agenda for a meeting think about what you are giving to your attendees and what you are asking of them.

Agendas, used well, can help make your meetings more productive, transparent, and connective.
An agenda can help someone decide if a meeting is relevent for them or help them know what to prepare.
During a meeting an agenda can be a written agreement on what you are spending time on as a group, showcasing what the group values enough to spend time on.
Finally, if you combine an agenda with live notes, this can turn into a written record of what was agreed to or ideas that were explored that can be referred to in the future.



## The beginning

The begining of anything is critical.
Beginnings of agendas are connecting points, bridges from our everyday live into our collaborative working spaces.
The start of any meeting happens when the first person logs into the call or walks into the room.
Often the first person to arrive can set the tone through their greetings of subsequent members.

The begining of an agenda is commonly focused on adminstration and housekeeping tasks.
There are several conventions you can build off of here.
[Sociocracy](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/meeting-format/) uses ADMIN to open their meetings.

- **A**ttendence: Take attendence. Tracking who shows up into the space shows that you care folks show up. Over time attendence can also help you spot people who might have a high degree of enthusasim for the topic but low capasity for the meeting or work.
- **D**uration: How long is this meeting going to be? Less important with meetings which are associated with calendar events, this can still help remind everyone of time constraints and check to see if anyone has to leave early.
- **M**inutes: Review the minutes of the previous meeting can remind people of what was discussed and decided at the last meeting. This is particuarlly useful for meetings that are infrequent.
- **I**nformation: Make any FYI announcements. In some meetings the call for information can be a dedicated agenda item (see next section).
- **N**ext call: When are you meeting next? Now is a good time to pull out your calendars and pick a time! The end of the meeting folks may be running off to their next appointments so getting this out of the way at the start ensures that everyone is acoomindated.

Part of housekeeping is tending to the emotional wellbeing of the group.
Providing a space for each person to check in with "How are you showing up?" can help people show up as a complete person, provide an opertunity for human-to-human connections, and set asside outside concerns to focus on the meeting.
Folks sometimes have a hard time naming emotions and it can be helpful to link in a [feelings wheel](https://feelingswheel.com/) to help folks identify what resonates with them in the moment.
When starting this practice it's very important to be clear that "Pass" is always an ok response.
Emotional sharing must be at-choice or it edges into cohersion and abuse.
When used well this can be a powerful connecting tool for your team.

Finally review and consent to the agenda.
Make sure everyone knows what is going to be talked about and that the group is in agreement that this covers the needs of the group for now.

This opening typically takes 5 to 15 minutes.
New groups will often require more time in this beginning phase.
